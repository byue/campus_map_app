# Tests that a linear graph of 2 nodes can be created,
# and that the two nodes can have multiple connections
# with different labels.

# Create a graph
created graph graph1

# Add 5 nodes
added node n1 to graph1
added node n2 to graph1

# Connect nodes with multiple connections
added edge a from n1 to n2 in graph1
added edge a from n2 to n1 in graph1
added edge c from n1 to n2 in graph1
added edge c from n2 to n1 in graph1
added edge b from n1 to n2 in graph1
added edge b from n2 to n1 in graph1

# list nodes of graph
graph1 contains: n1 n2

# list children of each node
the children of n1 in graph1 are: n2(a) n2(b) n2(c)
the children of n2 in graph1 are: n1(a) n1(b) n1(c)
