# Tests that a graph can be created, and a node
# can be added to the graph with an edge to itself. 

# Create a graph
created graph graph1

# Add a node
added node n1 to graph1

# Connect node to itself
added edge a from n1 to n1 in graph1

# list nodes of graph
graph1 contains: n1

# list children of node
the children of n1 in graph1 are: n1(a)
