# Tests that a graph can be created with 2 nodes
# that are connected in both directions.

# Create a graph
created graph graph1

# Add 2 nodes
added node n1 to graph1
added node n2 to graph1

# Connect nodes in both directions
added edge a from n1 to n2 in graph1
added edge b from n2 to n1 in graph1

# list nodes of graph
graph1 contains: n1 n2

# list children of each node
the children of n1 in graph1 are: n2(a)
the children of n2 in graph1 are: n1(b)
