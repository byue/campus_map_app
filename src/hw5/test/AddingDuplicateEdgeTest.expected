# Tests adding duplicate edge to graph.

# Create a graph
created graph graph1

# Add 2 nodes
added node n1 to graph1
added node n2 to graph1

# add same edge twice
added edge a from n1 to n2 in graph1
graph1 already contains the edge

# add a new edge with node arguments reversed
added edge a from n2 to n1 in graph1
