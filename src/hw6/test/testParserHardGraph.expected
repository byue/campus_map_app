# Verifies parser works on complex graph. 

loaded graph complex

complex contains: a b d e f j z

the children of a in complex are: b(7)
the children of b in complex are: a(7) d(6) e(5) j(8)
the children of d in complex are: b(6) z(1) z(2)
the children of j in complex are: b(8) z(9)
the children of e in complex are: b(5) f(4)
the children of f in complex are: e(4) z(3)
the children of z in complex are: d(1) d(2) f(3) j(9)

path from a to z:
