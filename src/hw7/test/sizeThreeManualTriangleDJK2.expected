# Simple test of Djikstra's algorithm.
# Verifies output of DJK for size 3 connected triangle graph.
# Third connection has a lower weight than the first 2.

created graph g

added node a to g
added node b to g
added node c to g
added node d to g

added edge 3.512 from a to b in g
added edge 2.410 from b to c in g
added edge 0.987 from a to c in g

path from a to c:
a to c with weight 0.987
total cost: 0.987
