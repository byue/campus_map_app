# Tests that a linear graph of 5 nodes can be created,
# and that each node has only one child.

# Create a graph
created graph graph1

# Add 5 nodes
added node n1 to graph1
added node n2 to graph1
added node n3 to graph1
added node n4 to graph1
added node n5 to graph1

# Connect nodes in a linear chain
added edge a from n1 to n2 in graph1
added edge b from n2 to n3 in graph1
added edge c from n3 to n4 in graph1
added edge d from n4 to n5 in graph1
added edge e from n5 to n1 in graph1

# list nodes of graph
graph1 contains: n1 n2 n3 n4 n5

# list children of each node
the children of n1 in graph1 are: n2(a)
the children of n2 in graph1 are: n3(b)
the children of n3 in graph1 are: n4(c)
the children of n4 in graph1 are: n5(d)
the children of n5 in graph1 are: n1(e)
